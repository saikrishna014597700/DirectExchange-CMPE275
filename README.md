## DirectExchange: CMPE 275 project

### Introduction
In order to avoid the overwhelming charges which are generally incurred due to international remittance, this application uses the method of peer to peer exchange so that we can mitigate the issue. A user can only access the app to the fullest once he/she is verified through email. Once a user is successfully registered into the SQL database, he will be able to post an offer or edit an existing offer if he has a minimum of two bank accounts in the system. A particular user can have the unrestricted right to view all the exchange rates which are available in the database. Users can browse ,filter and furthermore can propose counter offers. A user is able to keep an eye on his history related to transactions, which will also play a role in deciding the reputation score.Users can also interact with each through the messaging feature which is implemented in our application. Once the deal is made between two users, they will receive an email regarding this information and they have to proceed with the transaction within ten minutes or else the deal will be cancelled.
